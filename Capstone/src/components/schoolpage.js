I go to school! Urm... I am just like every other student out there, I learns and sometimes I understand. I was blessed to go to the public schools of Blanding, this includes, San Juan High, ARL Middle school, and Blanding Elementary. I am currently awaiting my junior year of high school and plan to pass.<span className="whisper"> (who doesn't?)</span></p>

      <h1 className="SubTitle">Elementary School</h1>
      <p className="Info">My years in Elementary School were cringey, I was a wreck, teachers had to bribe me with candy thru till the 2nd grade to stop me from crying. Then around 2nd grade I began to learn and stop being a puts. But this activity had come to late.</p>
      <h2 className="SubTitle">All Grades</h2>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">KinderGarten:</span> Mrs. Redds- A nice teacher who retired after my class left, she had to deal with my crying face.</p>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">1st Grade:</span>I can't Remember all I know is that she also retired after our class left and for some reason I don't think I liked her.</p>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">2nd Grade:</span>Mrs. James- No one liked her, kids spread a rumor that she tossed books at kids, this was not true, but I was still afraid and annoyed That I didn't get the 'good teacher'</p>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">3rd: Grade</span>Mrs. Hart- A very nice teacher who had a turtle, I started to actually not be a terrible punk around this age, however I started to be cringy, I just was akward now that I look back,I realize that I was kindof dumb and kindof smart.</p>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">4rth Grade:</span>Around this grade I had a homeroom but also I had 2 other teachers, so I wont list them but I can tell you, at this age I had no friends that I hung out with aside from my cousins I started to waste time at home on the computer and Xbox. However I was still passing classes pretty good, but he hated tests. They just stressed me out</p>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">5th:</span>In the Fith Grade I just played with my cousins and other random children on the playground.  At this point I was not thinking about my future. Luckfully I had relaxed a little on tests and started to like to learn. Also he started to watch Naruto and play Skyrim.</p>

      <div className="Description02">
      <h1 className="SubTitle">Middle School</h1>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">6th Grade:</span>The 6th grade went by pretty good, I was no longer a crybaby face child of cringe. but now I was a bit more mature. However somthing was wrong, due to the long summer I had become completly socialy akward. This was to bad, I wasn't super akward but I didn't talk as much and only hung out with my cousin Worthy every now and then. As for school I was doing really well, aside from the middle school being a bit confusing to navagate I was not worried in the slightest. In class I was understanding the material I and did the homework <span className="whisper"> (even if it was during class)</span>. I fell asleep a lot in class and still made it. Which I am so happy about.</p>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">7th Grade:</span>The seventh grade went by fairly quick, though I really enjoyed this year, I passed my classes with As and learned a whole ton. I made it through without dying. Anyway it went by without a hitch.</p>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">8th Grade:</span>In the 8th grade I made some more friends than I have had before, I was still passing through classes pretty easy and effieceint. At this point I started to think to the future, and more specifically highschool. I wanted my life to kick off into somthing unique and great, however the world I was in had no story. I somtimes reflected at this point and thought of how uneventfull my life had been, but maybe this was an illusion, just because It seems like we have no story, that is because we are the main charachter in our story.</p>

      <div className="Description03">
      <h1 className="SubTitle">High School</h1>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">9th Grade:</span>I entered highschool and again my summer took me away from friends, I was a socail hermit and had learned nothing. Luckfully my friends reached out to me at school making it a social haven, I Loved music, games, animation, and art at this point I was understanding that education is more important in my teen years than I had thought before. 9th grade was a great time where I finally understood what I was doing and I no longer wanted to miss out of the takings. I wanted to do somthing.</p>
      </div>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">10th Grade:</span>Though I wanted to no longer hide I was still limited, my summer job had made and forced me to socailalize so hopefully that would teach me, right? wrong, I was still a antisocial little weirdo and it seemed nothing could help me and maybe nothing will, but towards the end of this standard year I got a job. and hopefully that will teach me.</p>
