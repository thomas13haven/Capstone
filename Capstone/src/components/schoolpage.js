      <p className="Info">Though Thomas is a bit airy in the head I believe that he knows basic knowledge!<span className="whisper">Like the alphabet, I think</span> So dont undestimate his brain! he goes to school! Ok just kidding, urm... Thomas is just like every other student out there, he learns he sometimes understands, and he goes to school. Thomas was blessed to go to the public schools of Blanding, this includes, San Juan High, ARL Middle school, and Blanding Elementary. He is currently awaiting his junior year of high school and plans to pass.</p>

      <div className="Description01">
      <h1 className="Title">Elementary School</h1>
      <p className="Info">Thomas' years in Elementary School were cringey, the boy was a wreck, teachers had to bribe him with candy thru till the 2nd grade to stop him from crying. Then around 2nd grade he began to learn and stop being a puts but this activity had come to late.</p>
      <h2 className="SubTitle">All Grades</h2>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">KinderGarten:</span> Mrs. Redds- A nice teacher who retired after his class left, she had to deal with Thomas' baby face.</p>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">1st Grade:</span>I can't Remember all I know is that she also retired</p>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">2nd Grade:</span>Mrs. James- No one liked her kids spread a rumor that she tossed books at kids, this was not true, but thomas was still afraid and annoyed he didn't get the good teacher</p>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">3rd: Grade</span>Mrs. Hart- A very nice teacher who had a turtle, thomas started to actually not be a terrible punk around this age, he started to be cringy, like a little turdface, but this wouldn't last long.</p>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">4rth Grade:</span>Around this grade he had a homeroom but 3 teachers so I wont list them but I can tell you, at this age Thomas had no friends that he hung out with aside from his cousins he started to waste time at home on the computer and Xbox still was passing classes pretty good, but he hated tests.</p>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">5th:</span>Thomas just played with his cousins and other random childeren on the playground he was not thinking about his future he just ran around far and wee with the little goat man, had relaxed a little on tests and started to like to learn. Also he started to watch Naruto and play skyrim.</p>      
      </div>

      <div className="Description02">
      <h1 className="Title">Middle School</h1>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">6th Grade:</span>The 6th grade went by pretty good, thomas was no longer a crybaby face child of cringe. but now he was a bit more mature. However somthing was wrong, due to the long summer Thomas had become completly socialy akward. This was to bad, thomas wasn't super akward but he didn't talk as much and only hung out with his cousin Worthy every now and then. As for school he was doing really well, aside from the middle school being a bit confusing to navagate Thomas was not worried in the slightest. In class he understood the material and did the homework<span className="whisper"> even if it was during class</span>. Thomas fell asleep a lot in class and still made it. </p>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">7th Grade:</span>The seventh grade went by fairly quick though Thomas enjoyed this year, he passed his classes with a's and learned a whole ton, and this year he did the musical. This was his first real big preformance and he was a main. He made it through without dying. I think he was a lead? im not to sure. Anyway went by without a hitch.</p>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">8th Grade:</span>In the 8th grade Thomas made some more friends than he had before, he was still passing through classes pretty easy and effieceint. At this point Thomas started to think to the future, and more specifically highschool. Thomas wanted his life to kick off into somthing unique and great, however the world he was in had no story. Thomas somtimes reflected at this point and thought of how uneventfull his life had been, but maybe this was an illusion, for it is hard to see the beauty of the earth in a cave</p>

      <div className="Description03">
      <h1 className="Title">High School</h1>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">9th Grade:</span>Thomas entered highschool and again his summer took him away from friends, this socail hermit had learned nothing. Luckfully his friends reached out to him at school making it a social haven, Thomas Loved music, games, animation, and art at this point he was understanding that education is more important in his teen years than he had thought before 9th grade was a great time were thomas finally understood what he was doing and he no longer wanted to miss out of the takings.</p>
      </div>
      <p className="Info"><span className="highlight">10th Grade:</span>Though Thomas wanted to no longer hide he was still limited, his summer job had made and forced him to socailalize so hopefully that would teach him, right? wrong, Thomas was still a antisocail little weirdo and it seemed nothing could help him and maybe nothing will, but towards the end of this standard year he got a job. and hopefully that will teach me.</p>
